//! @op CreateEventSourceMapping
//! Persists ONE event source mapping in [`crate::state`]: the event source the request
//! names, the function it resolves, and every polling, filtering, destination and
//! logging setting the request stated, under a UUID and an ARN minted once. A mapping
//! asked to be active answers `Creating`, and the move to `Enabled` is owed by the CLOCK
//! (see [`crate::state::EventSourceMappingRecord::materialize`]); a mapping asked for
//! with polling paused has no poller to stand up and so is created already `Disabled`
//! (see [`crate::state::created_event_source_mapping_state`]).
//!
//! The event source has to be one `EventSourceArn` names: a resource of one of the
//! vendors and resource types that member enumerates, in this account (see
//! [`crate::state::names_event_source`] and
//! [`crate::state::event_source_is_mappable_by_this_account`]). Anything else is refused
//! with the modelled `InvalidParameterValueException` rather than stored as a mapping of
//! a source nothing could poll — stating the ARN format the source service the value names
//! is polled through where it names one at all, and otherwise that the source ARN sent is
//! unsupported (see [`unrecognized_event_source`]).
//!
//! The two settings the model leaves optional because only SOME of those sources need them
//! — the position a stream is read from, and the instant a position stated as a timestamp
//! starts at — are required for the sources and the position that need them, and a request
//! that leaves one out is refused as the request validation error it is (see
//! [`absent_required_member`]).
//!
//! What the mapping may be asked to MEASURE is held to that same source:
//! `EventSourceMappingMetricsConfig$Metrics` is "the metrics you want your event source
//! mapping to produce", which is a SET of the values its enum declares drawn from the ones
//! that source supports — two of the three are documented for the Kafka event sources alone —
//! so anything else is refused with that same modelled 400, naming the values the source does
//! expect, and no mapping is created (see [`crate::state::metrics_config_refusal`]).
//!
//! Where a record of a failed batch is handed to is held to the same source: a destination
//! of `DestinationConfig` is a resource Lambda WRITES that record to, and the kinds
//! `OnFailure$Destination` enumerates are the ones it writes to, so a destination naming a
//! resource of any other service is refused with that same modelled 400 and no mapping is
//! created (see [`crate::state::unsupported_mapping_destination`]) rather than stored as a
//! dead-letter path nothing could ever write to.
//!
//! A mapping on a QUEUE is also held to the queue's own configuration: a queue hands a
//! message to one consumer for the length of its `VisibilityTimeout` and makes it visible
//! again once that lapses, so a queue whose timeout is below the invoked function's
//! `Timeout` would re-deliver a message the function is still working on. That pair is
//! refused with the same modelled 400 (see [`crate::state::queue_visibility_refusal`]),
//! which is why the queue's timeout is read out of its own store here.
//!
//! Every mapping is also held to what the INVOKED FUNCTION'S EXECUTION ROLE may do: Lambda
//! reads the event source acting as that role, so a role the policies in force on it do not
//! let read the named source is refused with that same modelled 400 and no mapping is
//! stored (see [`crate::state::event_source_authorization`]), rather than wired up as a
//! trigger that could never fire.
//!
//! One function reads a given set of records through at most one mapping, so a create
//! that would read records the function is already mapped to is refused with the modelled
//! `ResourceConflictException` ("The resource already exists, or another operation is in
//! progress") and nothing is stored. Which records those are is the source TOGETHER WITH
//! what is consumed inside it — the bootstrap servers for a self-managed Apache Kafka
//! cluster, which carries no ARN, and the topic or the destination queue for a source read
//! per topic or per queue (see [`crate::state::polled_event_source`]).
//!
//! An accepted mapping on a queue also STARTS POLLING it: "Lambda reads items from the
//! event source and invokes the function", so this call arms the poll loop
//! ([`crate::state::drive_sqs_pollers`]) that takes each batch out of the queue and hands
//! it to the mapping's function. Nothing waits for a poll here — the loop runs on its own
//! clock — and what one poll does, including why an unprocessed batch is left on the queue,
//! is documented in [`crate::state::sqs_poller`].
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `CreateEventSourceMapping::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `CreateEventSourceMapping`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:

//!
//! Creates a mapping between an event source and an Lambda Event Function. Lambda reads
//! items from the event source and invokes the function. For details about how to configure
//! different event sources, see the following topics. Amazon DynamoDB Streams Amazon
//! Kinesis Amazon SQS Amazon MQ and RabbitMQ Amazon MSK Apache Kafka Amazon DocumentDB The
//! following error handling options are available for stream sources (DynamoDB, Kinesis,

//! returns an error, split the batch in two and retry. MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds – Discard
//! records older than the specified age. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to
//! infinite (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires MaximumRetryAttempts
//! – Discard records after the specified number of retries. The default value is infinite
//! (-1). When set to infinite (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires.

//!   within the parameter's absolute range, they are not allowed
//! * `MaximumRetryAttempts` (MaximumRetryAttemptsEventSourceMapping, range -1..10000) —
